    "** The created CFD domain is now read into the CFD package of interest to setup the CFD simulation. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis for different flow conditions are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end user will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions. **\n",

    "## Setting up a CFD simulation has following four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ###### Setup Model/s:   \n",
    "According to the physics of the flow field user will select required model/s to simulate the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ###### Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:   \n",
    "User will define the physical and thermodynamical properties of the working fluid/s and solid/s in the problem.    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. ###### Setup Boundary & Zone Conditions:    \n",
    "Solving the governing equations of the flow (i.e. system of partial differential equations) requires well-defined boundary conditions within the CFD domain. These conditions are selected and defined in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ###### Setup Solution Methods:    \n",
    "In CFD simulations the governing equations of the flow are solve numerically. Based on the physics of the problem appropriate numerical schemes and solution methods are selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section the details for the above-mentioned four steps of the CFD simulation setup process for the case study of <font color='red'>insert the title of your case study</font> are explained in great details. As a general guideline, to setup a CFD simulation in OpenFoam it is recommended to start with files from one of the provided default tutorials in OpenFoam located in OpenFoam/run/tutorials. Users should find appropriate tutorial such that the general physics of the chosen tutorial is close to the problem of interest of users. This way, the majority of the required physical settings are pre-set and the others can be changed/modified accordingly. For example for the problem of <font color='red'>insert the title of your case study</font> the tutorial of <font color='red'>insert the title of chosen tutorial</font> located at OpenFoam/run/tutorials/<font color='red'>insert the path of chosen tutorial</font> is used. Using the previously developed file, the above-mentioned four steps for CFD simulation development is done via editing the corresponding files, where the settings are defined and are located in the main working directory.\n",

    "It should be noted out that since OpenFoam settings are set within various configuration files located in different folders, in form of available as editable text files, there is no good practice to provide a summary of the steps here in the tutorial similar to STAR CCM+ and Fluent. Instead at each step the contributor should mention the full path of the file configuration file (e.g. `\\constant\\polyMesh`) and insert the section of the code for readers using $```C++ [code section] ```$ . It is highly recommended to check out the OpenFoam Simulation files written for previous case studies. \n",

    "Now that all boundary conditions and settings for the CFD simulation are defined. User can **initialize** the solution through an educated guess to start the iteration process: `/solve/initialize/compute-defaults/velocity-inlet`\n",
    "Solution initialization would incept the flow field variables, such as velocity and pressure, based on the defined values by user. For the current problem the CFD domain is recommended to be initialize by values of velocity and pressure at the inlet.\n",

A general rule of thumb for converged solution is to have continuity residuals of 10E-3.
